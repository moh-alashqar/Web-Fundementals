### Objectives

- Practice using the [Box Model](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp) properties: `padding`, `border`, and `margin`.
- Practice what we've learned about `Flexbox`
- Practice using different values of `justify-content`.

Use `margin` and `padding` to adjust the spaces between the rows and use `flexbox` properties to be able to put each image in its proper place. Set the images to all have a uniform size.

img.octocat {
    height: 200px;
}

Pick your favorite colors and your favorite images from [the Octodex](https://octodex.github.com/) to recreate the layout you see below.
