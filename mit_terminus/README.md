# MIT Terminus

---

By now you are all terminal command/command prompt pros (okay, well you are on the road to being one at least). As you have now seen, terminal commands are a great tool for being able to traverse your system to create, read, update, and destroy information as you want. Well, some bright minds at MIT decided to take this one step further and make these commands into a game they call "Terminus". Â Utilizing the commands for a Linux system you can become an intrepid explorer traversing and interacting with a world of fantasy and fun!
