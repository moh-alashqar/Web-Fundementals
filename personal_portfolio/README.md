# Personal Portfolio - Content

---

We'll be learning a lot about how to style our website soon, but that doesn't mean we can't get started on our personal portfolio today! Create the content for our Personal Portfolio using only HTML. Our portfolio should talk about who we are and list some of our favorite projects, hobbies, our favorite things like sports, our favorite tv show, etc. Our portfolio can look however you want it to look, but the HTML document should use as many of the following tags as we can:

- HTML
- head, title, meta description,
- body, div, a, p, h1, ul, li, table, tr, th, td

**\*\*Note\*\* You can add borders to the table by adding border="1" to the table element. This will not be allowed once we learn css.** **Ignore the error on the validator.**

- At the bottom of the page, include a form that uses the following tags:
    - form, label, textarea, input type="text", input type="submit"

Below is an example of how we may want our portfolio to look (for now):

During the rest of the bootcamp, we'll get to use these HTML tags a lot. Don't feel pressured to memorize all of these HTML tags and how they exactly work, as we can refer to this section later and we'll feel more comfortable with HTML as we learn more about CSS and other topics in the curriculum. Once we have done the basic assignment, move on to the next chapter and we'll gain a deeper understanding on these HTML tags we've just learned.
