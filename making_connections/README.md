# Making Connections

---

### Objectives

- Add **JavaScript** functionality to a previous assignment
- Use **JavaScript** to remove `elements` from the webpage

We've spent a lot of time working on some past projects and that hard work is something we can reuse. Let's return to the _Profile Page_ assignment and add the types of **JavaScript** functionality we've previously learned onto it!

If we weren't happy with how ours turned out then feel free to use this already completed **HTML** and **CSS** [code](https://assets.codingdojo.com/boomyeah2015/codingdojo/curriculum/content/chapter/1619370348__profile-page.zip).
