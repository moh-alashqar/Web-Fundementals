### Objectives:

- Use what we've learned about **CSS** to recreate the following website

This is a tricky assignment, let's make sure we build in layers working from the top down and from the outside to the inside.

This assignment may take us upwards of 4 hours to complete, this is normal as **CSS** can be time consuming. **We strongly suggest working in groups**, pair programming is a common programming practice.
