## A Sandwich Factory

In this assignment we'll be making pizzas in JavaScript! And if we're going to just make one pizza we can define it all at once like the sandwich we see below.

But what if we wanted to make multiple sandwiches? We could define a function that allows us to craft a sandwich!

## The Pizza Oven
