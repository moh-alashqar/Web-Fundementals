---

### Objectives

- Make a project using Git and Visual Studio Code
- Push the project to [Github](https://github.com/join) where we can submit our code and share it with the world

If you've been following along with the previous readings, you may already have your first repository uploaded onto GitHub. If not, now is the time to upload your project! For this assignment, we've prepared a quick walk-through going over the steps.  

[Github](https://github.com/join) is a tool we'll commonly encounter in the industry so it's best to start getting used to using it now!
