# Video Preview

---

### Objectives

- Practice using `onmouseover` and `onmouseout`
- Practice working from an existing code base

For this assignment we'll be working with some existing code (download [here](https://assets.codingdojo.com/boomyeah2015/codingdojo/curriculum/content/chapter/1624039965__video-preview.zip)) to add a video in. We'll want to find a free video that we want to work with from [https://www.pexels.com/videos/](https://www.pexels.com/videos/).Â  Next we'll want to add the video into a video tag in the HTML. To make the website more interactive add hover events to play and pause the video when hovering.

### Hints:

We may need to make use of the `.play()` and `.pause()` methods - [reference](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_video.asp)

We may also need the video to be `muted` as modern browsers want users to interact with (click) videos for them to start playing.
